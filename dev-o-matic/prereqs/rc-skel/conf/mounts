# TODO The volumes to --mount from `docker run`.  This is currently a WIP.
#
#   If HOSTPATH doesn't exist the entire mount line is ignored.
#   Whitespace-delimited lines.
#   Available variable substitutions:
#      $USER - The current user's username
#      $USERSTATE - Location of persistent user state folder on host


# HOSTPATH            CONTAINER PATH
# ========            ==============
#$USERSTATE/home       ~
#$USERSTATE/linuxbrew  /home/linuxbrew
