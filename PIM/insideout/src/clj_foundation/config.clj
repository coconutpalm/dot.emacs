(defmacro defconfig
  "Defines a configuration lookup function of type (=> s/Any [s/Keyword]) that returns configuration
  values from the EDN file specified by variable or the default resource.  File resolution is done
  in the following precedence:

  * A Java system variable with its name matching config-file-location-envar.
  * An operating system environment variable with its name matching config-file-location-envar.
  * A Java resource with a relative path specified by default-config-resource.

  The configuration file itself should represent a single Clojure map with keywords as the keys and
  any value (including another map) as the value.  Thus calling a config function generated by
  defconfig might look like:

  (config :topic :subtopic :entry-name)

  An optional third parameter can either be a map of type {s/Keyword s/Any} or a seq of keywords and
  values representing default values that will be substitued into the configuration file using the same
  resolution rules above.  E.g.: The developer can choose to have either separate dev and prod config
  files or to define variables inside the configuration file with default values for dev that will be
  overridden in prod via Java system properties or environment variables."
