  "Patterns DRY up code and provide a vocabulary for conversation.  This package helps Clojure deal with
  types from Java, makes it easier to build maps that represent abstract data types, provides functional
  programming utilities, and adds a Nothing type that behaves as an identity value for maps, sequences,
  and strings under their various concatination operations.  (For Category theorists, it's a monadic zero
  for these types under concatination and mapcat.)  It also provides Nothing constants for cases where
  Nothing means 'error', 'no result', or simply 'use default settings'."

  * You can use it as a result in mapcat when you want nothing appended to the output collection.
  * You can cons a value into nothing, resulting in a seq.
  * You can assoc values into a nothing, resulting in a map.
