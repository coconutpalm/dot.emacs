Provides support for managing resources such as SWT
fonts and images.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package contains support for managing resources, including:
<ul>
<li>
font registries (<code>FontRegistry</code>) - for hanging on to the SWT font
objects needed by an application</li>

<li>
color registries (<code>ColorRegistry</code>) - for hanging on to the SWT color 
objects needed by an application</li>

<li>
image registries (<code>ImageRegistry</code>) - for hanging on to the SWT image
objects needed by an application</li>

<li>
image descriptors (<code>ImageDescriptor</code>) - surrogate object for creating
SWT images</li>

<li>
string conversion (<code>StringConverter</code>) - for parsing property files</li>
</ul>
The JFace resources module is an independent JFace module requiring a basic
knowledge of SWT and the JFace property change event mechanism. Familiarity
with other JFace modules is not required.
<p>Image descriptors are objects that knows how to create an image on demand.
They serve as a lightweight representation of images in situations where
no SWT display exists yet, and are used mainly in conjunction with image
registries. This package contains the image descriptor framework, which
is a simple hierarchy rooted at the abstract class <code>ImageDescriptor</code>.
The framework includes abstract subclasses for composing images (<code>CompositeImageDescriptor</code>)
as well as a ready-made concrete subclass for loading images from files
(<code>FileImageDescriptor</code>).
<p>The class <code>JFaceResources</code> maintains global state on behalf of
JFace itself consisting of JFace's own image registry, font registry, resource
bundle, and preference store.
